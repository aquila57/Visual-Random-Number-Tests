# Win or Lose

Win or lose is a random race between pixels to see which pixel
is the furthest to the right by the end of the race.  At each
stage of the race, a 3 sided coin is flipped.  Either a pixel
stays in place, or it moves forward one pixel, or it moves
backward one pixel.  Follow the leader at the top of the screen
to see how many times the leadership changes during the race.

To run the race, type:

./winlose
